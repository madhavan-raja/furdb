#+TITLE: FurDB

A small and space-efficient Database Management System that allows you to allocate the size of individual data types in bits (not bytes).

* Installation
This project (along with the documentation) will be moved to [[https://crates.io][crates.io]] at some point in the future. Right now, you can clone this repo with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/madhavan-raja/fur.git
#+END_SRC

and use the =FurDB= crate inside the src directory.

* Usage
As of now, this is just a Rust library. No REST API or command line interface has been (or will be) implemented in this version. The only way to use it is in an existing/new Rust project.

Import the crate using
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  use furdb::{Converter, FurColumn, FurDB, FurDBInfo, FurDataType, FurTable, FurTableInfo};
#+END_SRC

** Creating a new database
=FurDB::new()= takes two parameters.
- =db_path= of type =PathBuf=, which contains the directory to create the database.
- =db_info= of type =Option<FurDBInfo>=, which contains the database information.

If the database already exists, the information provided as part of =db_info= is ignored. Otherwise, a new database is created with the information present in that.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  let db_path = PathBuf::from("~/FurDB/SampleDB");
  let db_info = FurDBInfo::new("Sample Database");
  let db = FurDB::new(db_path, Some(db_info))?;
#+END_SRC

** Creating a new table
=db::get_table()= takes two parameters.
- =table_id= of type =&str=, which has the ID of the table---or the name of the directory representing the table.
- =table_info= of type =FurTableInfo=, which contains the table information.

If the table already exists, the information provided as part of the =table_info= is ingored. Otherwise, a new table is created with the informatino present in that. Tables are always created within the database directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  let table_id = "SampleTable";
  let table_info = FurTableInfo::new("Sample Table", None)?;
  let tb = db.get_table(table_id, Some(table_info))?;
#+END_SRC

** Creating the columns
A column in a Fur Tables consists of:
- =id= of type =&str=, which should be the key of the value in the =HashMap= of the data.
- =description= of type =&str=.
- =size= of type =u128=, which should specify the number of bits that the data should use.
- =data_type= of type =FurDataType=, which contains the name and =converter= of the said type.

Create a column with
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  let sample_column = FurColumn::new(
    "sample_column",
    Some("Sample Column"),
    11,
    integer_data_type,
  );
#+END_SRC

** Adding data to the table
The data for a row is stored in a =HashMap=, with the key corresponding to the =id= of the column and the =value= corresponding to the data.

Add the data using with
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
  let sample_data = [
    HashMap::from([("sample_column", "7")]),
    HashMap::from([("sample_column", "6")]),
  ];

  tb.add(&sample_data)?;
#+END_SRC

** Getting the data
The data is returned in a =HashMap=.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let result = tb.get()?;

for row in result {
  println!("{:?}", row);
}
#+END_SRC
